                  <p>Before taking any action in relation to a Personal Plan, you must take into account any other factors apart from the Personal Plan of which you are or ought to be aware.
                      </p>
                  <p>For example, we always recommend that you seek professional medical advice before embarking on any exercise programme. Your decisions to engage in any exercise programme should take into account any medical or other professional advice that it available to you as well as using your own personal judgment as to what activity is safe for you to engage in.
                      </p>

                      </p>
                  <p>For example, where a program was tailored for a woman who was not pregnant, this would not be appropriate for her to use after becoming pregnant.
                      </p> 
                  <h3>When to Contact Your Physician</h3>
